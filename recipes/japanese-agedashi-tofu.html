  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (10.5 ounce) package firm silken tofu</li>
    <li>2 cups water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons light soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dashi granules</li>
    <li>Â¼ cup all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
    <li>vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>2 green onions, chopped</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Place the block of tofu between sheets of paper towels. Set a plate on
      top; add a 3- to 5-pound weight to the plate. Press tofu for 15 minutes;
      drain and discard the accumulated liquid.
    </li>
    <li>
      Meanwhile, combine water, soy sauce, mirin, and dashi in a saucepan.
      Bring to a boil over medium heat. Remove from heat and set aside.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remove weight, plate, and paper towels. Cut tofu into 3/4-inch cubes.
      Place flour in a bowl and lightly coat tofu with flour.
    </li>
    <li>
      Heat oil in a heavy pot and fry tofu until golden-brown, 4 to 6 minutes.
      Fry in batches if necessary so as not to overcrowd the pot. Place fried
      tofu in a serving dish and pour sauce on top. Sprinkle with green
      onions.
    </li>
  </ol>
